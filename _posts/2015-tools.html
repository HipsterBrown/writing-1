> Design is Redesign 
> - Jan Michl

When I'm designing for the web, I design in the browser. There are a variety of
reasons for doing this, but it really comes down to two things:

1. It allows me to more accurately understand the constraints of the platform I am designing for.
2. I can edit code faster than I can edit visual assets.


I do not have a history of getting something I'm designing perfect on the first
try. If I did, I probably wouldn't care about being able to iterate through
design ideas quickly. Iterating quickly is of exteme importance to me. 
Because I'm never right on the first try and I don't think that will be changing any time soon.

There are times in which typing is not the bottle-neck. There are times when it is wise to sit and stare. 
Digesting what has already been created is an essential part of any design process. 
But I'm not here to talk about those times. It's hard to speed up thinking about design in many cases. So 
I won't try to talk about that problem today.

The speed in which you can iterate through designs in the browser is directly
linked to how quickly you can edit text.

I'm probably going to be expressing my ideas through typing for many years to come. Whether it's 
writing an email to a colleague, or editing code to visualize an idea - 

Vim is the most powerful tool I have ever used in speeding this process up.

The faster we can all iterate through designs - the more quickly we can move the web forward.
And that's something I'm pretty interested in.
