# Square One

There are many different ways to open files and set up your working environment.
This is not a comprehensive list of ways to open and manage files in vim. It IS
a comprehensive list of the way in which I open and manage files in vim. 

I use terminal vim, so all instructions are, for terminal vim. I also personally
alias vi to vim, but for clarity I will reference Vi Improved on the command
line. Just know that I'm not typing three characters every time. That would be
the worst. Also, until later in the post when I explicitly declare it, I will be
using this as my .vimrc and nothing more (no plugins).

```
set nocompatible      " Uses vim vs vi settings must be set first
syntax on 	          " Turn on syntax highlighting for recognized filetypes
set history=1000      " Default is 20, I'd rather set this to âˆž
```

We must walk before we can run, so let's get going.

### 1. Opening a single file
```
  vim filename   
```

Awesome that is easy enough but not very powerful.

### 2. Opening more than one file
```
vim filename1 filename2 filenameN
```

What this does is open up multiple files. But gasp, you can only see one? Why is
that? Well the other files are in hidden buffers. Okay, let's try to navigate
around a little bit with three files open shall we?

### 2a. What the fuck did I just open? 
I can't remember, seriously, what list of documents I just had vim open in
separate buffers. Ok, run this mindblowing command.

```
:buffers
```

This will output a list of buffers (with assigned numbers! oh how useful).
So now we can run something like this 

```
:buffer 3
```

This will, wait for it, switch the window to display the file stored in "buffer
3." Okay, so you went to buffer 3. But you didn't want buffer 3, you totally
meant to go to buffer 2. Now, currently we are only dealing with three buffers right now, but
if you're like me you often have many files in buffer at any given point in
time. So instead of navigating to buffer 2 by using :buffer 2 - we're going to
do something even crazier.

```
:bp
```

Wait, what the fuck does that do? It brings you to the previous buffer. Note,
that it's not the previously VIEWED buffer. It's the previous buffer in the list
of buffers. :bp stands for :bufferprevious, which is also a valid command but is
SO many characters to type and I'm lazy. Note, vim commands will tab complete so 
you can write :bu<Tab>. Doing this you might notice :buffernext or :bn for
short. This will, crazy I know, switch to the next buffer.

So now we can make the window display a single file in buffer at a time. And
hopefully we can switch between those buffers with some amount of ease.

Now I don't know about everyone else but I generally like to look at more than
one file at a time. Or I like to look at the same file but it's a super long
file and I want to look at the top and bottom at the same time.  

Just so we are on the same page let's all switch to first file in our list of
buffers by running yet ANOTHER command.

```
:bfirst
```
