  That quote is from the year 1821 by a man named Charles Babbage. He invented the idea for the first programmable computer.
  If Charles Babbage saw how most people wrote CSS in the year 2013 he would be very sad.

  In 2005 when I first started authoring css, the only thing I did to check the quality of
  my code was open a browser and look at the page I was designing. If it looked good I assumed
  my css was aces. In 2005 I did not often come to the conclusion that my css was aces because
  things rarely looked good.
</p>
<p>
  This lead me to believe that my css was horrible because, well, everything looked...
  horrible. My "solution" to this problem was what I suspect many people do when they run into a problem with
  css: I wrote more css. Sometimes this worked. But mostly it did not.

  <a href="http://csslint.net" title="csslint">CssLint</a> is an open source tool that will help you write better css.
  It does basic syntax checking as well as applying a set of rules to the code that look for problematic patterns or signs of inefficiency. The rules are all pluggable, so you can easily write your own or omit ones you don't want.

   mkdir -p ~/.vim/autoload ~/.vim/bundle; \
