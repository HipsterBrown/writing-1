title: "Unicode Domain on Github Pages"

<p>
  I recently set out to set up a site I have hosted on github pages with a unicode domain name. Why? Because I view a unicode skull in my domain as being better than NOT having a unicode skull in my domain. 
  Dave Copeland wrote up a great post how to set up a unicode domain - but his instructions require the ability to manipulate your apache config. Github pages does not allow for this at all - but luckily this is not an issue.

<h1>Steps</h1>

<ol>
  <li>
    Find a unicode domain you like. This is the hardest part, I swear. The sheer amount of options is stifling to say the least. There are many domain registers that will not sell you a domain name with unicode characters. Per Copeland's suggestion I went
    ahead and used <a href="http://dynadot.com/" title="Dyna Dot Domain Registration">Dyna Dot</a>.
  </li>
  <li>
    Each unicode domain comes with an asciification of the url. Something that looks like xn--h4hg.ws - copy this.
  </li>
  <li>
    You'll need to change your Name Server settings from your Dynadot account page. Set your "A" Record Type to 204.232.175.78 (This will point it at Github pages). Save your settings, you're all down with Dynadot. 
  </li>
  <li>
    On the gh-pages branch of the project you want to host add a CNAME file 
  </li>
</ol>
