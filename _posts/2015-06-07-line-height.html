<h2>Glossary</h2>

<blockquote class="pln mln">
  <p><b>line-height</b> is a css property</p>

  <p>
    <b>lead</b> <i>[rhyming with red]:</i> <br>
   Originally a strip of soft metal used
   for vertical spacing between lines of type. Now meaning the
   vertical distance from the baseline of one line to the baseline of the next. Also
   called <b>leading</b>.

<p class="i f2-ns">
  When you declare a line-height in css it never needs to be used with a unit.
</p>
<p>
  It defaults to being relative to the font-size. This is equivalent to setting
  a percentage i.e:<br>
  <code>line-height: 140%</code> <br>
  or using em <br>
  <code>line-height: 1.4em</code>
</p>
<p>
  A website generally only needs 3 or 4 line height values.
</p>
<h2>Solid </h2>
<code class="f5">line-height: 1</code>
<p>
  When a line-height has a 1:1 ratio to the size of the type (line-height: 1)
  this is known as setting type solid. Most typefaces set at solid are
  unreadable - so this should be avoided in most cases.
</p>

<p>
  One reason to set line-height to 1 is for single lines of text that need to
  be set flush at the top with a corresponding element that has embedded media
  or a solid background. For example a piece of text next to an image where we
  want the top of the typographic element to be perfectly aligned at the top
  with the image.
</p>

<h2>Larger font sizes for titles </h2>
<code class="f5">line-height: 1.2 to 1.3</code>
<p>Titles require less leading than body copy. You generally want something around 1.2-1.3.</p>

<h2>Body copy</h2>
<code class="f5">line-height: 1.5 to 1.75</code>

   Many people with cognitive disabilities have trouble tracking lines of text
   when a block of text is single spaced. Providing spacing between 1.5 to 2
   allows them to start a new line more easily once they have finished the
   previous one.

  I generally set copy to 1.6 to aid in readibility. But this becomes a matter
  of taste between this defined range and is not generally an issue of
  readability.

<h2>Improper uses of line-height</h2>

<p>Often times you see line-height applied with a pixel values as a unit for one of the following reasons</p>

<ul>
  <li>Affecting/setting the height of an element</li>
  <li>Vertically centering text within an element</li>
</ul>

<p>
  Altering the height of an element should generally be done with a padding value
  selected from a ratio based scale that relates to your type scale.
</p>

<p>
  Using line-height to vertically center things is very brittle and only works
  when there is one line of text.  E.g if you have a font-size of 24px and you
  set line-height to 48px to vertically center the text, if the copy wraps it
  will have 200% leading which will most likely look very awkward and should thus
  be avoided
</p>
<p>
  Vertically centering elements should be done by setting vertical-align on an
  element set to display: table-cell that is contained within an element set to
  display: table.  This is a pattern I will document with coding examples. The
  benefit being it works in more contexts and can be used to vertically center
  text elements against media objects across all breakpoints.
