<p class="intro">
  <b>tl;dr</b> If you want to learn vim, don't use google, just read everything in :help.
  <br> <br>
  You shouldn't even read the rest of this post. Just fire up vim, type :help 
  and start exploring. What you'll find is better than anything you'll find here. 
  I promise.
</p>
<p>For those of you who need more convincing, read on.</p>

<p>
  When I first started learning vim my learning process always started with the same two steps.
  </p>
<ol>
  <li>www.google.com</li>
  <li>type "vim how to x"</li>
</ol>
<p>
  This method yields varying levels of success. Because believe it or not there are a lot of 
  people who will give you bad vim advice. Bad might be an understatement. There is some truly horrible advice
  that should really be avoided. I'm probably one of those people but I digress.
</p>
<p>
  If you want to learn vim your best bet is to ignore the internet and use vim to learn vim. How meta.
  So let's learn how to let :help, help you.
</p>
#### De-mystifying :help 
<p>
  For many of us designers and front-end developers, documentation can be scary. 
  Reading the manual is generally somewhere in step never, not step 1. It shouldn't be this way.
  As someone who has 1 degree in studio art and 0 degrees in anything involving computers let me tell you this:
  It's not just a blob of technical jargon that you won't understand.


I <b>used</b> to think that :help was most useful when you had a command you wanted to learn more about. 
And <b>it is</b> great for that. But :help isn't just a mindless list of commands and their definitions. 
Vims :help is a treasure trove of well-written articles on how to edit text efficiently. 
The user manual chapters aren't nearly as dense and dry as you might expect from the help docs 
of a command based text editor invented on one of <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ADM-3A" title="ADM3A">these.</a>
</p>
<p>
There is something important to remember when you are learning Vim.
Vim isn't just your old IDE but faster. It's a different way of thinking. Learning vim is a constant exercise 
in how to not get stumped by <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Candle_problem">the candle problem.</a>
</p>
<p>
  Taking the time to passively browse through the :help docs will keep your brain thinking creatively about
  how each new command/motion can be applied to your current workflow. Most likely, as you're stumbling around,
  you'll discover solutions to problems you didn't even realize you had. 
</p>
<h4>Recommended reading</h4>
<p>
  While it might be hypocritical to recommend reading anything BUT the :help docs at this point,
  the following books, articles, mini-series have been helpful in shaping how I think about using vim. <br ><br>
