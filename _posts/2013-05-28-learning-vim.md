<p class="intro">
  <b>tl;dr</b> If you want to learn vim, don't use google, just read everything in :help
  <br> <br >
  There is an argument that you shouldn't even read the rest of this post. Just fire up vi, type :help 
  and start exploring. What you'll find is better than anything you'll find here. Whatever it is you
  think you're looking for in this article, I promise you your time will be better spent reading :help.
</p>
<p>If, for whatever reason I haven't convinced you to not read this article yet, read on.</p>
<p>When I first started learning vim my learning process always started with the same two steps.</p>
<ol>
  <li>www.google.com</li>
  <li>type "vim how to x"</li>
</ol>
<p>
This method yields varying levels of success. Because believe it or not there are a lot of 
people who will give you bad vim advice. I'm probably one of those people but I digress.
</p>
<p>
If you want to learn vim your best bet is to ignore the internet and use vim to learn vim. 
Step one in that process is to start letting :help help you.
</p>

#### De-mystifying :help
<p>
I <b>used</b> to think that :help was most useful when you had a command you wanted to learn more about. 
And <b>it is</b> great for that. But :help isn't just a mindless list of commands and their definitions. 
Vims :help is a treasure trove of well-written articles on how to edit text efficiently. 
The user manual chapters aren't nearly as dense and dry as you might expect from the help docs 
for a command based text editor invented on one of <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ADM-3A" title="ADM3A">these.</a>
</p>

<p>
There is something that is very important to remember when you are learning Vim.
Vim isn't just your old IDE but faster. It's a different way of thinking. Learning vim is a constant exercise 
in how to not get stumped by <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Candle_problem">the candle problem.</a>
</p>
<p>
  Taking the time to passively browse through the :help docs will keep your brain thining creatively about
  how each new command/motion can be applied to your current workflow. Most likely, as you're stumbling around,
  you'll discover solutions to problems you didn't even realize you had. 
</p>
<h4>Recommended reading</h4>
<p>
  While it might be hypocritical to recommend reading anything BUT the :help docs at this point,
  the following books, articles, mini-series have been helpful in shaping how I think about learning &amp; using vim. <br ><br>
