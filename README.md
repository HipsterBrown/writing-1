# JKL
===================
A light-weight JKL scaffolding that's ready to deploy after setting up one config. Still being developed.

    git clone 
## Rake tasks
===================
#### rake dev
     jekyll --server --auto

Sets up jekyll server for dev on port 4000. Site is regenerated everytime you save a file. 
NOTE: Changing _config.yml will require a restart of the jekyll server to see changes.
To restart server, go to terminal tab that server is running in then press
    ctrl+C â‡§  enter

#### rake sass
     sass --watch _sass:css 

Starts Sass polling to regenerate css on file save.

There are two layouts, one for posts, one for other pages. Layouts are stored, creatively, in jkl/_layouts/
Folders with an underscore are not copied over to _site
